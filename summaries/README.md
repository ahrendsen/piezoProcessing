This is where summaries of data collected can be written.

I wrote [longDrift.md](longDrift.md) to show how the laser drifts over the course of 3 hours,
even if data isn't being collected on the apparatus.

I wrote [profileWidth.md](profileWidth.md) after being surprised at how much
smoother the data was when using the full image to calculate the profile
rather than a small slice of 100-200 pixels. It seems logical to me to 
keep the 150 pixel width for now, but if you get to the point that
you want to write a paper and publish data, you could run the larger 
slice overnight to get more prescise results.
